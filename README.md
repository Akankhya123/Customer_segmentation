# Customer_segmentation
This project demonstrates the concept of segmentation of a
customer dataset using k-means clustering in python. The data
set contains the annual income of ~300 customers and
their annual spend . We will use the k-means clustering
algorithm to derive the optimum number of clusters and
understand the underlying customer segments based on the
data provided.
